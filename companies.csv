709,"","","","",,"Zasio Enterprises, Inc. has become the standard by which other records management software and consulting companies are measured. The firm was founded in 1987 by Mr. Kevin Zasio. The company was originally based in San Jose, California, but it relocated its corporate operations to Boise, Idaho in 1993.
 
The firm was founded based on one vision—to provide organizations in both the public and private sector with an affordable computer software solution to enable them to establish total life-cycle management and control over their records throughout the organization.
 
This vision was realized by the introduction of Versatile Enterprise, the company’s flagship product. This product literally made records management history during the 1990’s, because it was the world’s first records management software system to incorporate functionality for the management of both active and inactive records into a single system. This capability met with strong market acceptance—today Versatile Enterprise is installed in hundreds of organizations throughout North America and in numerous other countries.
 
In 1995, the company extended the range of its records management services when it established its Records Management Consulting Division. The strategic objective behind this decision was to offer a total solution—both software and high-level expertise—to those clients that require it.
 
Another major breakthrough for Zasio Enterprises was the development of “Retention!” in 1998. Retention! Was an advanced legal research and schedule development software product designed to help customers develop records retention schedules and policies that are legally compliant. The initial release included over 6,000 legal citations governing the retention requirements for records. The latest version, now known as Versatile Retention 8, contains over 30,000 citations, as well as many new features.
 
In 2001 Zasio expanded its records management software suite to meet the needs of small and midsize companies who are looking for more affordable options. First Versatile Express, a streamlined version, and then Versatile Professional, a mid-range tool for larger organizations, were released. Both products were designed so that organizations can upgrade to one of the higher-level products as their records management programs grow.
 
Through the years, several add-on applications have been developed to expand the capabilities of the main Versatile software packages: Versatile Web, Versatile Import, the Versatile Notification System (VNS), the Versatile Electronic Records Management System (ERMS), and the Versatile Color Label Designer.
 
Zasio Enterprises has continually made efforts to supply our customers with the best records management software products and services. Our central mission is and will remain to use state-of-the-art technology to help our clients find solutions to the records management challenges facing them today, at an affordable cost.

768,"","","","",,"TrackVia helps business people build their own databases and workflow applications
 
First Things First...Before we jump into everything TrackVia does, it's often helpful to set some baseline definitions. 
What is a database? In short, a database is a structured set of data held in a computer. For example, maybe you keep a list of your key business contacts and their email addresses and phone numbers in a spreadsheet file. But unlike a simple spreadsheet, a database allows you to do many more things. For example, for each of your contacts, you might want to keep track of every interaction you have with them -- when you called them last or what you talked about. A database would allow you to link your ""contacts"" with the ""activities"" that are specific for each of them. 
What is a workflow application? A workflow application is software which automates - at least to some degree - a process or processes. So for example, when you buy flowers on the Internet and enter your order information, the ""software"" automates the process of charging your credit card and submitting your order. If you look around your business, you'll see all sorts of processes. Some are probably already automated while others or not. A solution like TrackVia not only allows you to automate those processes, but do it in a way that makes most sense for your unique operation. 
Of course, these are very simple and basic definitions. But hopefully they help give you a sense for what we're talking about. 
The Three Most Common Use Cases:
Productivity Applications: An easier, more versatile and powerful alternative to desktop-based solutions like Excel or Access.
Department Applications: A more affordable and flexible alternative to generic business software or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions. 
Custom Applications: An excellent solution for people who want to create a custom application that’s unique to their industry, business or department.

By delivering a software-only solutions based on open networking standards Vyatta is opening the layer 3+ networking stack to be available as an application for physical, virtual and cloud architectures.

MixMatchMusic is the evolution of an idea -- we set out to solve a problem we faced ourselves. Once we set about satisfying our own requirements, it was a natural next step to extend the solution to others.

Get Connected

MixMatchMusic has created tools that musicians and fans want and need in order to create the deep and lasting connections that build loyal audiences and enable musicians to profit from their music. These highly interactive tools enable musicians to constantly interact with through custom, mobile applications; engage fans creatively through remix contests and collaboration promotions that enable any fan with an internet connection to participate in the creative process; and virally promote their music on Twitter and other social networks.
Why Should I Care?
More than nine million musicians are trying to connect with more than 200 million music fans, according to some estimates. The huge numbers alone would suggest the odds are in their favor. Yet the channels musicians have traditionally relied upon to get their music discovered, promoted and sold are increasingly irrelevant and as a result, musicians are increasingly on their own, without labels, record stores or radio to help them. The artist's challenge is to convert casual fans into loyal fans, and loyal fans into paying customers. The modern music fan has changed, and getting music discovered is no longer enough. Musicians have to engage and involve casual listeners in order to build deep and lasting connections with them, and to convert them to loyal fans. These connections are what drive sales of the concert tickets, band merchandise and CDs artists need to pay the rent and put gas in the van.

RunRev customers include some of the world’s leading universities, scientific organizations, global business and consumer brands, small businesses and individual creators.

LiveCode enables users to create applications using the platform of their choice and deploy to virtually every desktop computer in use today, with customers creating applications that run on the desktop or server, for the PC, Mac, or Linux.

LiveCode began as an expert Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for MetaCard, a graphical user interface and development environment that supported UNIX, Windows and Mac. MetaCard built on the success of its predecessor HyperCard, recognized for its English-like language structure that was far easier to learn than BASIC. It was this plain-English syntax that attracted RunRev CEO Kevin Miller to use HyperTalk as a youth, and later acquire much of the technology in 2003.

Until recently, building mobile business apps was expensive and time consuming, requiring the expertise of custom engineering shops.

With ViziApps, companies of all sizes can create mobile business apps including back-end data access, all without coding.

In ViziApps, all the app building is done with drag-and-drop wizards and pick-and-choose tools.  Several features, such as storyboarding capability, precision positioning and multiple types of back-end plugins for data access (including access to QuickBase, Google Docs spreadsheets), make it easy to create rich, attractive mobile business apps quickly and cost effectively.

795,"","","","",,"If you’ve ever been excited to have a perfect new tool that simplifies and brightens your day (think your smartphone or GPS navigation), you’ll understand small businesses’ excitement when using our products.

We create cloud-based, receivables automation technology that is designed especially for small businesses to simplify the lives of business owners. Easy-to-setup and easy-to-use, our products will help them spend less time chasing, sorting, and monitoring payments – so they do more of what they want to do.

How it Began

The company started in 2005 when CEO Eric Remer and co-founder Allen Wolff, owning a business that published ads for property managers, posed a question to their clients, “How can I make your life easier?”. The answer they received was unanimous: Find a way to collect rent easier. Like so many businesses in the service sector, they were spending far too much time waiting for payments and reconciling books.

While researching a solution, Eric and Allen found that most products for small businesses were just truncated versions of big business offerings and were not a great fit. Seeing an opportunity to fill a gap in the marketplace, the idea for PaySimple was born.

What We’re Doing Now

Today, PaySimple offers products directly to small business merchants, and also partners with organizations to provide the technology and support for white-labeled products, like AcceptPay® for American Express® and ZipSM for Ink from Chase® cardmembers.

Since its inception, PaySimple has been completely focused on the success of small businesses across the service sectors. Its technology provides small businesses with the three fundamental abilities inside one seamless technology that enable them to run their businesses better—accept payments, manage customers, and automate billing. PaySimple has made big-business efficiencies available to small businesses at a fraction of the cost.

Learn more about what we’re up to in our press section.

Our Culture

One of the most important aspects of our company is our culture. Our founders' and the management team's vision is to create an environment that fosters growth and opportunity for PaySimple's team members, partners, investors, and customers.

Prelude’s mission is to enable our clients with the service, control, features and functionality they require to meet their objectives relating to the streamlining and automating of their payment processing. Our passion is to surpass their expectations. The company’s team of system architects, engineers, programmers, and client support specialists is dedicated to our clients’ successes. Implementing Prelude’s technology can make a tremendous difference in your payment operation. Information and functionality spread across multiple systems will, for the first time ever, be combined in a single, flexible, easy-to-use application. Our clients, although their environments are quite unique, all commonly agree the results can are positively dramatic:

Streamline your processes (and reduce your costs) by consolidating and automating cumbersome, complicated, and repetitive tasks. Issuing payments, reconciling bank accounts, and compiling data are all made easier with a centralized solution that brings your disparate systems together as one.

Expand your scope of payment capabilities by adding new functionality for electronic payments, bank reconciliation, OFAC compliance, mobile payments, escheat processing, and more. The modular design of our software enables you to add new features to your existing implementation (one system at a time or all at once) at any time.

Tighten your security with PayPilot’s built-in features and controls. You define which users can access the system and what functions they’re allowed to see/perform. Set amount limits by employee for each payment type. Utilize the system’s configurable approval process to generate emails when payments exceed business-rule thresholds. Add positive pay security to defend against the threat of check fraud. The list of security features, from login authorization to detailed audit trails, is quite extensive—and extremely powerful.

Stay just the way you are. Meaning, you don’t have to change your workflows and terminology to fit our products. They adapt to fit yours. Screen layouts, field labels, reports and system processes are all configurable to match your unique business rules.

Or, change! Of course, if things do change (and they always do), you can rely upon our flexible technology to change right along with you.

Don’t be held hostage by your existing systems. Many of our clients have gone through the process of upgrading one or more of their legacy systems. Given the potential impact on financial performance and customer satisfaction, touching a payment system is always risky. With Prelude, however, existing systems can be easily relieved of their disbursement function without disruption to key operations.

Create negotiating leverage with your vendors. Consolidating multiple payments into a single check or EFT reduces the overhead of your vendors and improves their cash flow. In return, our experience has shown, these benefits translate into price discounts for you.

Make better business decisions with access to payment information that you’ve never had before. Our standard and customized reports, combined with our dynamic ad hoc querying abilities, let you see your organization in a whole new light.
Businesses rarely take on any new initiatives that don’t affect their bottom line. While we may not be able to increase your sales, we definitely can help you reduce your costs.

We help our customers to understand their organizations and translate requirements into quality software with our tools that are both richly featured and simple to use.
As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. We do see visual modeling a great way to communicate efficiently, especially during project crunch times. It makes collaboration between people skilled in different areas both effective and fruitful. So why not let textual descriptions take a back seat and support the more time-friendly visuals to do the same job, if not better?
We also see that existing modeling software tools are often less than ideal. They may be too costly. Or they lack ease of use and require substantial investment in training. So we believe there are users who may opt for visual modeling in spirit but not necessarily in practice. This is where our tools come in to fill this niche with frugal innovation.
We have an uncompromising belief — software should be user-friendly, even when it is intended to solve a fairly complex problem. We stick to it and all of our products are built around this idea.

Easy And Simple:
Ease-of-use is the foundation of a great user experience. That means every feature must be intuitive, absolutely necessary, and streamlined for simplicity. As a company, it should be easy to do business with us: straightforward communication; frictionless processes; and transparent business practices.

Listening To Learn:
Our product improves exponentially when we spend time with our users and listen to what they have to say. We keep channels of communication open to our users: usability labs, our feedback forum, keeping an eye on Twitter. And as we develop the product, we maintain a humble approach, holding our own ideas loosely and constantly iterating.

Lean And Fast:
Both our product and development processes allow us to be nimble, responsive, and flexible. An Agile development team, a simple product architecture, and a mindset of ‘constant improvement’ means that when we see something to add, streamline, or fix, we can get it done quickly.

Excellence:
We’re committed to building great products that help small businesses succeed. That means reliable, scalable, and bug-free tools that you can count on.

Xyleme™ was built around the idea of revolutionizing the way people publish and consume learning content. From this principle, Xyleme’s learning suite (Xyleme LCMS, Bravais™ and Pastiche®) has been developed to enable the creation, management and personalized delivery of education and training content. Our solutions are powered by the 100% XML-based Xyleme LCMS (Learning Content Management System), providing the industry’s most efficient content development platform for the rapid reuse of content across all types of web, print, tablet and smartphone outputs.

The future is now

Based firmly in the belief that the way people consume learning content is ever changing, just like learners, Xyleme has been an innovator in the marketplace from inception. Xyleme invests heavily in product development and is consistently first to market with technologies that have a direct and immediate positive impact on our clients’ business goals. Xyleme's most proud innovations include Bravais and Pastiche.

Bravais is Xyleme’s revolutionary cloud-based content delivery solution. So what does that mean? Content is authored or created in the Xyleme LCMS. Once final content is ready (after edits, versioning, etc.) it is stored in the Bravais cloud. From the Bravais cloud, the content can be delivered to any device via specialized and custom apps that have been downloaded to the devices. This is especially important when creating personalizing learning experiences for each individuals needs.

Pastiche is Xyleme’s end-to-end solution for rapidly deploying interactive and privately branded iPad or Android apps. Again, what does this mean?! Content is created in the Xyleme LCMS. The content is then stored in the Pastiche store (similar to the App store but it’s customized to your organization and you), and then distributed to your tablet.

Be more than monolithic

Agile Development is at the core of Xyleme’s product development processes. This collaborative and iterative framework enables the release of new Xyleme LCMS, Pastiche and Bravais versions every three months compared to the industry standard of 12 to 18 months.

At the forefront of innovation, Xyleme’s open XML platform allows organizations to keep pace with rapidly changing educational, training, and more important now than ever before, consumer requirements. The XML platform also allows for the rapid reuse of content across all types of web, print, tablet and smartphone outputs. Finally, the open nature of XML means your content is completely future-proof, ready for today’s and tomorrow’s technologies.

Who we are

We’re not only passionate suppliers of learning technology, but everything else that goes into creating a great learning experience. Xyleme’s founders are pioneers in the industry and were among the first developers to leverage XML-based technologies for learning content reuse. Our executive team, educated at some of the world’s top institutions, leads with a multi-faceted expertise, including extensive experience building and growing global companies. Xyleme’s services team consists of people who have designed and implemented enterprise-wide learning initiatives, bringing a strong, client-focused perspective to the project management experience.

The zoomable canvas makes it fun to explore ideas and the connections between them. The result: visually captivating presentations that lead your audience down a path of discovery.

Prezi was officially launched in 2009 by co-founders Adam Somlai-Fischer, Peter Halacsy and Peter Arvai. 

Adam Somlai-Fischer is an internationally renowned architect and visual artist who has been working with zooming presentations since 2001. Adam found that a zoomable user interface (ZUI) enabled him to explore the “big picture” overview of a floor plan and then zoom into the detail of individual rooms. Because there was no commercially-available zooming presentation editor, each presentation had to be coded by hand. Audiences were wowed and approached Adam to discover what presentation software he used. A few persuaded him to give them access to his code. Finally, in 2007, Budapest University of Technology professor Peter Halacsy convinced Adam to develop an editor so that anyone could make zooming presentations. After creating a prototype, they recruited a business-minded entrepreneur, Peter Arvai, to join as CEO to help them build a product and a company. Prezi was launched in April 2009 from Budapest, leading to investments from TED Conferences and Sunstone Capital. The San Francisco office was established in November 2009.

In addition to the management products of the individual solutions, security programs for PDAs, smartphones and embedded devices are also offered. Our clients include renowned national and international corporations, educational institutions and public clients. Avira AntiVir Personal, used by millions of private users, represents a significant contribution to security.

In Tettnang, near the Lake Constance Avira is one of the biggest regional entrepreneurs. The company has several locations in Germany and partnerships in Europe, Asia and America. Worldwide approximately 300 persons are employed. Dozens of researchers in various virus labs attend to local and global threats on the virus front around the clock.

In addition, Avira constantly adapts to the current security requirements of the users. AntiVir is therefore one of the worlds first ever products with dialer detection. This dialer detection was very quickly followed by the detection and removal of adware and spyware. Current developments in this field include the detection of already active root kits. The introduction of a firewall and behavior blockers is a matter of course. In-house development also allows the development of various new special scanning technologies, for example for PDAs, handhelds and embedded devices.

Aviraâ€™s national and international customers include renowned corporations listed on the stock exchange but also educational institutions and public authorities.

Datto is the only hybrid-cloud BDR/IBC vendor that provides instant on- and off-site virtualization, and screenshot backup verification.

Products
The Datto product line address the specific needs of small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The product line is comprised of Datto SIRIS, Datto SIRIS Lite, Datto G Series, and Datto GenISIS, and serves a wide range of vertical markets including: healthcare, financial, education, banking, legal, manufacturing, retail, and municipal. 

Proprietary Technology
Datto SIRIS is the only BDR solution to offer instant on-site and off-site virtualization, screenshot verification of backups, and Intelligent Business Continuity all from one simple management interface.

Inverse Chain TechnologyTM
Datto’s proprietary technology always keeps the newest full backup at the front of the incremental chain. This technology takes data directly from the server, creating a VMDK (virtual machine disk) every time a backup initiates, storing the data in that state on the local device.  This allows backups to be independent of each other and not reliant on others.  So a failed or missed backup will not require a full backup to be completed.

SpeedSyncTM
Datto’s proprietary technology for quickly and efficiently transferring files to and from the cloud provides greater data integrity, reduced network traffic, and keeps customer’s offsite backups up to date, particularly in low bandwidth environments and those with busy network traffic.

ShadowSnapTM
ShadowSnap is Datto’s advanced backup technology. An imaged-based, agent driven technology, it was created in conjunction with StorageCraft, a leader in backup technologies. Custom modified by Datto development, ShadowSnap supports dissimilar hardware BMR technology, streamlining the BMR process with easy driver injection technology.

The Datto CloudTM
Owned and operated by Datto, the Datto Cloud provides secure data backup of all Datto devices. Data stored on local Datto devices is replicated to Datto’s redundant bi-coastal SSAE16 certified data centers. Datto’s data centers use global biometric authentication access methodology to track all authenticated data center personnel and prohibit the entry of any unauthorized persons. The data centers are staffed 24/7 and cannot be accessed by the public. Remote critical facilities management teams monitor, report, and record all access and activity to ensure the most comprehensive security possible.

Channel
Datto is 100% channel-driven. Datto’s Intelligent Business Continuity solutions are available exclusively through Datto Partners in North America and Europe. Our flexible solutions can be customized to work in any environment and across all platforms. Datto offers the best products at affordable prices, with straightforward with no complicated fee structures.

In May 2009, Expensify raised $1M, hired some additional engineers, and went to Istanbul for a month in order to write the award-winning Salesforce.com Expensify application. Later that year, they demoed an integration of Outright and Expensify at TechCrunch50 2009. In December of 2009, Expensify 1.0 launched to high acclaim. 

What is Expensify? Expensify imports expenses and receipts straight from your credit card or bank account, submits PDF expense reports by email, and reimburses reports up to $10,000 entirely online. With the 1.0 launch, Expensify bolstered its QuickBooks export features, helping bookkeepers, accountants, and finance departments nationwide to integrate their expense reports with ease. In September 2010, Expensify raised an additional $5.7M to keep fighting the war against sucky expense reports.

Preventing a data breach starts with knowing where your sensitive information exists and our software makes it both simple and affordable to not only find confidential data, but also protect it from leakage and theft.

    Discover
    Classify
    Remediate
    Enforce
    Report

Your first step to preventing a data breach is knowing from where it can happen. Discover and inventory where all sensitive data is stored.
	Discover
Greatest Risk 	Complete Coverage 	Toxic Data
Over 2/3rds of data breaches involve data stored or 'at rest'. Our products all concentrate on data at rest to help your organization effectively and affordably prevent data leakage. 	Search entire file systems on Windows, Linux, and Mac, e-mail servers and apps, databases, websites, and cloud storage. 	Automatically inventory confidential information including Personal Information (PII), Payment Cards (PCI), Healthcare Records (PHI), and intellectual property (IP).
Back to top
Classify 	
Make decisions knowing what data to destroy, secure, or whitelist. Classify information and take steps to reduce exposure.
Sensitive Information 	Classification 	Reduce Risk
Automatically find any occurrence of confidential information (i.e., Credit Cards and PCI Data; Medical Records and ePHI; Personal Data and PII; and Intellectual Property) 	Categorize and tag data files with relevant information to assign results and secure your information. 	Empower your employees to take action by not only reporting on risk, but also reducing it by removing or limiting access.
Back to top
Remediate confidential data and shrink your sensitive data footprint.
	Remediate
Shrink the Target 	Minimize Costs 	Secure Toxic Data
Reduce the number of locations you need to protect by digitally shredding unnecessary copies of sensitive files. 	Spend less money meeting compliance objectives by reducing the scope of your covered environment and consolidating data. 	Encrypt and/or redact the files you need to keep thereby limiting your exposure to a data breach.
Back to top
Enforce 	
Enforce correct behavior and prevent a data breach.
Comply with Regulation 	Verify Remediation 	Change Behavior
PCI-DSS, HIPAA, HITECH, State Data Breach Laws, FERPA, Red Flag Rules, Sarbanes-Oxley, FISMA, GLBA, Mass. 201 CMR 17, and more... 	Don't rely on employees to secure their data. Monitor actions centrally to confirm and validate that data has been protected. 	Empowering employees to find and protect the historical data they own leads to good habits in the future.

1059,"","","","",,"Since 2001, Serengeti led the transition from law departments using random software or databases that required manual entry of paper and emails, to streamlined processing for e-billing, matter management and performance analytics. From our initial release, Serengeti has provided law departments totally new ways to work, setting new standards and best business practices for the efficient management of legal work in-house and, most significantly, with outside counsel. 

When we set out to develop the world's first collaborative matter management and e-billing solution, we searched for a name that illustrated the power of a vibrant and inter-connected legal community. The Serengeti plains in Africa, with its constant activity, diverse array of wildlife and dynamic landscapes invoked the images and ideas at the very core of Serengeti Law.

Voluminous sketches, whiteboards, bits and bytes later, in 2001, we created Serengeti Law and launched Serengeti Tracker. The buzz was swift, and now more than 18,000 in-house counsel and 35,000 law offices worldwide automatically process and reconcile legal e-billing and matter management with Serengeti Tracker—saving time, increasing productivity and substantially driving down cost. To date, more than 600 in-house law departments across 186 countries utilize Tracker to manage the business of law.

Why Transactional Content Management?

There are so many different kinds of content management solutions out there that analysts have started breaking up the universe, known as Enterprise Content Management (ECM), into pieces.  We’ve been delivering solutions in the Transactional Content Management (TCM) arena much longer than it’s been called TCM.  Our definition is content management within the context of your transactional business process, and within your business systems, like Microsoft Dynamics AX, NAV and GP.  Simply – document management when and where you need it.

TCM has evolved from separate ERP and content management systems in Generation I, to Generation II characterized by integrated ERP and content management with multiple, disparate interfaces.  KwikTag led the way by being the first solution embedded in Microsoft Dynamics back in 2004.  Today, we are working on Generation III: providing the single, best user interface for each role in the TCM process, whether within an ERP system, another application, a web portal, or just a knowledge worker’s need to access a reporting dashboard

Honored among the Inc. 5000 for four years in a row, nettime solutions has been nationally recognized as one of the fastest-growing private companies in the US and was ranked among the Top 100 Arizona companies.
our mission

By embracing technology, we deliver a secure, innovative, cloud-based workforce management solution for forward thinking organizations.
our history

Since 1996, nettime solutions has had the vision to bring affordable business tools to market using leading technologies. Our first time and attendance software product, HourTrack, controlled biometric devices and gave businesses who previously could not afford these tools the opportunity to control labor costs by eliminating wage theft and buddy punching.

Knowing that the web was the future of software use and development, our culture of experimentation created the first completely browser-based Software as a Service (Saas) time and attendance solution in 2000.

Since 2008 we have exclusively delivered time and attendance as a cloud-based solution, allowing us to efficiently implement and support it for our customers and partners.
our present

Available in 2013 and built from the ground up, our latest software program, stratustime, defines the next leap in cloud-based time and attendance. Conceived on the dual premises of delivering a great user experience and providing business analytics, stratustime is a powerful business decision solution that brings enterprise-level tools to businesses of every size.
our advantage

Our innovative spirit led us to pioneer cloud-based time and attendance that is a truly multi-tenant solution for our clients. Traditional time clocks require additional hardware and polling software to collect and transmit time, but we eliminated this software by developing a cloud clock that connects directly to stratustime to provide real-time punch data and employee self-service. And, while updates to on-premise software require intervention that results in detailed planning and work stoppages, stratustime’s zero-impact deployments won’t interrupt your productivity. With no additional required training and no effect on your workflow, you can decide when and if you want to use new functionality we add to the system.","","",,false,"",,,"",Unknown,,nettime solutions,https://d3uimxdj41cg3o.cloudfront.net/companies/41bfd20a38bb1b0bec75acf0845530a7-e298a29c5b4fd1d4e31cb26540bd446f/resources/logo_normal.png?1438766706,,"",Privately Owned,"",,0,,nettime-solutions--2,"",,Full tax,"",Unknown,http://www.nettimesolutions.com/,"",No,,,""

History
2003

Blatant^ was founded in 2003 when Mike Eggermont and Michael Owens found that the online courses they were designing for a number of clients became practically unusable once they were imported into the LMS systems that existed back then. Often Mike and Mike were asked to also administer these learning management systems and the experience was inhumane at best.

Armed with 3 computers, a spare bedroom and an eager programmer, Mike and Mike began developing Absorb LMS, while paying the bills building content for various industries. Originally much of the LMS usage was in safety training for the Energy Sector, but the LMS was always designed to accommodate any organization that had training needs.
2007

In 2007 the National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM) looked at over 30 systems to train hundreds of thousands of sports professionals and Absorb LMS won the competition. Mike and Mike realized at this point that the world was ready for Absorb LMS and focused the company’s efforts on a SaaS software model.
2013

By 2013 Absorb LMS had grown to support around 500 organizations world wide in nearly every industry vertical. Absorb LMS remains privately owned by Mike and Mike.

Your contract types - and you can have as many as required – can be custom built one time for repeated use, or built on-demand by picking and choosing from your locked-down clause library. The information that populates your document depends on the contract type you choose when requesting a contract, the information fields you complete in the creation wizard, and any language rules you set up based on variations. 

 And with one extra step from the basic Contract Management setup, you've created a contract document that you can send to your vendor for red-lines. Track all variations, accept and reject changes, and finalize your agreement all within our software, leveraging the power of Microsoft Word. Because face it, all your users know and love Word. No reason to learn anything new here. 

 Contract Authoring gives your team – whether you are Sourcing or Legal – the power to quickly create contract agreements, speeding the time to negotiation and completion. What's more, you're performing this work in the same environment in which you run your sourcing events and manage your suppliers, so you have all of your source to contract information in one place.

Our Matrix Software solutions significantly reduces risk and costs while increasing revenues and vastly improving productivity.


Compelling Solution

 
Forward thinking organizations realize they can no longer afford to rely on templates and e-mail attachments for mission critical procure-to-pay and quote-to-cash contract processes. As the leading innovator in the market, CLM Matrix is changing the way companies look at their contracting processes. Gains in efficiency and effectiveness from Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) implementations are far too compelling for organizations to ignore. ROI’s are typically measured in months, not years.


Built on Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS)

 
As the only CLM solution built exclusively on the Microsoft Office technology platform, CLM Matrix pioneered wizard-driven, policy-based Smart Contract Engines and Smart Workflow Engines to dynamically create and drive “intelligent contracts that enable contract intelligence.”


Smart System

 
Why do we call our solution “smart”? Integral to the Matrix Enterprise architecture is a core rules engine that “makes decisions” on how to navigate through a business process and how to construct the necessary contract, given its described characteristics. Companies have long needed a way to guarantee each legal agreement is composed correctly according to business policy, is complete, and includes no conflicting statements. Usually this desire is met by managing policy across departmental personnel, with periodic, follow-on audits. Using creative techniques, CLM Matrix has mastered the ability for process/policy administrators to enter such business policy into the “brain” whereby it is then guaranteed to be fully adhered to and governed. With this, it is easy to understand why our solution is called the “Matrix”: The rules engine implements business policy by controlling and driving business process, document creation, clause insertion, routing/approval, notifications, alerts, assignments, and escalations.


Proven Technology

 
Now in its 8th major release, CLM Matrix best practice software tools enable organizations to increase process efficiency and recapture lost profits while driving revenue velocity. By continually staying at the forefront of emerging technologies, CLM Matrix delivers the most cost effective business critical solutions demanded by today’s challenging business environment.


Clear Focus

 

CLM Matrix's mission is clear:  To equip our customers with process and policy best practices, technology tools, and tactics that can be used as major drivers of buy-side and sell-side contract management transformation.

1213,"","","","",,"About Zscaler
Zscaler is the industry-first multi-tenant SaaS security provider.
When was Zscaler founded?

The company was founded in 2008 by Jay Chaudhry, Zscaler’s CEO.
Where is the company located?

Zscaler is headquartered in San Jose, CA with office locations worldwide. For more information, please visit our Contact Us page.
What does Zscaler do?

Zscaler is transforming enterprise security with the world’s largest Security Cloud built from the ground up to safely enable users doing business beyond the corporate network. Zscaler’s Security Cloud processes over 12 billion transactions a day with near-zero latency to instantly secure over 12 million users in 180 countries, with no hardware or software required. More than 4,500 global enterprises are using Zscaler today to simplify their IT operations, consolidate point security products, and securely enable their business for mobility, cloud and social media.
What countries does Zscaler operate in?

Zscaler currently secures 12 million users in 180 countries.
What is the company’s vision?

The world of IT security is undergoing a transformation brought on by the consumerization of the enterprise through mobile devices, cloud applications and social media. While traditional security appliances focus on limiting the impact of these trends, Zscaler is enabling businesses to embrace innovation securely, while delivering a superior user experience. Just as cloud applications  transformed the market for CRM, Zscaler saw an opportunity to transform the IT security market with a cloud-based solution built from the ground up to securely enable mobility, cloud applications and social media.
What is a Security Cloud?

Appliance-based network security solutions were designed to protect static corporate networks, and routing mobile and remote traffic through these appliances often slows traffic to an extent that negatively impacts the user experience. Zscaler’s Security Cloud acts as a checkpost in the cloud, scanning all incoming and outgoing traffic between any device, anywhere in the world, and the Internet to identify and block potential threats.
Who Uses Zscaler?

Zscaler’s Security Cloud solutions are used by more than 4,500 global enterprises to secure over 12 million users worldwide. Our current customers are large global industry leaders that are trying to solve the difficult challenges of securing users beyond their corporate network. Our largest customer is National Health Services (NHS) with 1.6 million users. Other customers include British American Tobacco (BAT), which uses Zscaler to secure users in over 180 countries, as well as Society General, RalCorp, Pitney Bowes, and VMware.

1278,"111 Sutter Street, Suite 300",Hunter Dulin Building ,San Francisco,United States,," It was eight years ago that the founders of Innotas had a vision for improving the IT management process by adding greater accountability, visibility, and transparency to that process. Having extensive experience in the IT management space, they knew that on-premise IT Governance and Portfolio Management solutions were very costly, took months to deploy, and required expensive service engagements. Based on that vision and industry experience, they saw Software as a Service (SaaS)- or now commonly called cloud computing or the Cloud- as the path they needed to take for a cost-effective, comprehensive IT Governance solution. Innotas would offer the right blend of simplicity and best-of-breed functionality in Project Portfolio Management (PPM) and Application Portfolio Management (APM), in a way that would make easy for IT executives to align their IT organizations with the overall goals of the business. And so was born — a fresh approach to IT Governance, PPM, and APM- that brought together all of the needed components into one comprehensive SaaS solution.
 
However, providing a comprehensive, best-of-breed PPM and APM SaaS solution was only one part of the equation for the founders of Innotas. Major IT Governance, PPM and APM initiatives also require significant change management that cannot be accomplished without cultural adjustments and executive commitment, meaning people play a large role in the rapid adoption of the Innotas solution. Innotas extended its commitment to excellence and customer success by aligning every client project with an Innotas engagement manager.
 
Hundreds of companies in a wide range of industries, including government, healthcare, education, financial services, retail, manufacturing and more, are leveraging the power of the Innotas cloud solution for their IT governance and portfolio management needs. Additionally, Innotas has received numerous industry awards, including:

ThinkStrategies: Best of SaaS Showplace Award

Application Lifecycle Management
TechExcel's Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) solutions enable enterprises to focus on their strategic goals of product design, project planning, development and testing by providing a collaborative and ""knowledge-centric"" environment. Traditional approaches to ALM stipulate that every phase of software development - from product concept to strategy, planning to implementation, and finally to verification and delivery - rely on separate tools and processes. TechExcel DevSuite is built around the best-practices insight that knowledge is central to any product development initiative. By eliminating the silos of knowledge that exist between different teams and in different locales, DevSuite helps enterprises dramatically transform their development processes, increasing both the efficiency and overall quality of their end products. This strategy helps teams communicate better and reduce their cycle times, allowing the right products for the right markets to be developed in the shortest possible time.

TechExcel's Service and Support Management solutions provide enterprises with total visibility and actionable intelligence for all service desk, asset management and CRM business processes. The fully integrated service desk solutions support ITIL best practice methodologies and deliver improved financial performance, increased management functionality and organizational alignment. As enterprises rely more heavily on the IT organization, reactive and stand-alone help desks are no longer sufficient to handle the growing demand and complexity of today's distributed businesses. As the IT organization finalizes its move from a cost center to an integral part of the infrastructure, service and support management functions must rely on a single version of truth to ensure that processes are optimized and that the entire business flourishes.

In 2002, NetBlazon developed its first sales tax module for the Miva Merchant shopping cart. It was called Zip Based Sales Tax, and it gave small retailers the ability to charge different sales tax rates by 5-digit zipcodes. At the time, it was a breakthrough for that cart.

Today, taxing authorities have store owners' heads swimming with the need to collect taxes for their state, local, county, city, and metro areas. Tax boundaries are no longer nice and neat! While one state streamlines their tax collection, another does not - but ALL states expect to be paid. This leaves many etailers hoping for the best, but expecting the worst, when it comes to the accurate collection and reporting of sales tax figures.

With this in mind, we began working on the creation of a SaaS solution that would provide the most accurate sales tax calculations available today, at a price that is affordable for most retailers. With our TaxTools suite of products, retailers gain freedom from having to maintain boundary or tax rate information on their own site.

CMO has remained true to this vision, throughout 6 product version releases and countless new features, often driven by client requirements and industry regulation. The result is a GRC software solution with a greater range of out of the box features than anything else on the market today. Another result of this vision is the flexibility the product provides end users to “reconfigure” or adjust their solution as and when their GRC landscape changes.

We are a full-service social media and digital marketing agency that empowers brand marketers to not just adapt to change, but create it.

You see, in advertising, communication used to be a one-way street, but now it’s a two-way conversation on social media between brands and their consumers. Most brands know they need to engage with their consumers in social; however, they feel lost, not knowing where to begin.

We’ll help you find your way in an ever-changing social landscape, and build valuable connections with your consumers across all social channels. We believe social influence is the essence of modern marketing. In today’s highly fragmented markets, your brand needs to integrate social media as a key business practice if you want to build lasting relationships with your consumers. Let’s embrace it together.","","",,false,"","","","",Unknown,"",SOCIAL CONTROL,https://d3uimxdj41cg3o.cloudfront.net/companies/9a4400501febb2a95e79248486a5f6d3-cbdd4184a19523dd6ebe8c20e081f276/resources/logo_normal.png?1438766948,"","",Privately Owned,"",,0,,socialcontrol,"",,Full tax,"",Unknown,http://socialcontrol.com/work/medpost-social-content/,"",No,,,""

A consensus among friends and co-workers about the state of security in the enterprise led to the idea of Infogressive. With a strong background in security, networking and applications Infogressive was born with the mission that pushy salesmen and ingrained tendencies to buy the biggest and fanciest new security equipment is not the best way to tackle the IT security problems that exist in the enterprise.

What We Do

Infogressive was founded upon a single focus: Information security. We reduce risk by creating defense-in-depth networks and we help implement best practices. We achieve this mission through three primary means:

We acquire and continually train elite talent that prioritizes customer service and executing our standards of excellence.
We identify market leading, effective technologies that reduce risk economically.  We become experts on these technologies to help our clients learn and leverage them into their environments.
We build and maintain a network of close, trusted relationships with people involved in the cyber security space all over the world. These relationships include: Information security experts, government, law enforcement, private industry, and academia. These relationships help us stay abreast of what is going on in our industry now and in the future. It also allows us to engage these relationships when needed, as we are the first to admit we can’t know everything.
We live and breathe security. Some call us paranoid, some call us nerds; we call ourselves vigilant cyber security experts. While the world is being educated about what we do through daily headlines about breaches, we work tirelessly to make sure our clients aren’t part of the media frenzy that is sure to continue for decades to come.","","",,false,"","","","",Unknown,"",Infogressive,https://d3uimxdj41cg3o.cloudfront.net/companies/752d25a1f8dbfb2d656bac3094bfb81c-9dd9824587eae93a09b675a1ee247858/resources/logo_normal.png?1438766975,"","",Privately Owned,"",,0,,infogressive,"",,Full tax,"",Unknown,http://www.infogressive.com/,"",No,,,""

The Designjet 3D printer produces detailed, structural parts from a strong ABS plastic, suitable for real-world functional testing of prototypes, and as models for purely illustrative purposes across the boardroom table.

Our models are also suitable for small runs of specialised or customised parts in actual products; either in new products or as repairs to existing items.

The Designjet 3D Color can print single-colour models in the following colours: Ivory, Grey, Blue, Olive Green, Yellow, Orange, Red and Black

We ourselves have found quite a number of applications around the office and even in our homes where our 3D printed parts have breathed new life into previously broken items. Some examples so far have included: water heater knobs, replacement clips and brackets for flat-pack furniture, retaining clips for a car bumper and parts for a (2D) printer!

QuickForge is not just about 3D printing; Our parent company also provides CAD design services as well as CAM and CNC machining facilities for the production of parts in a wide range of materials. Please enquire for more information: info@quickforge.co.uk.

The organization has operated for nearly 70 years with the goal of providing market-leading insurance services to insurance carriers, agents and policyholders.  In 2000, due to dramatic growth and diversification into multiple insurance service and product offerings, the MacNeill Group and its affiliate organizations formed a holding company, branded as Focus Holdings.  The Focus Holdings group provides an array of insurance products and services, including MGA and wholesale brokerage support, program management, residual market support, technology services, BPO services and premium finance support, as well as products through a risk-bearing insurance company.

Focus Technologies significantly expanded its product offerings in 2010, via the organization’s merger with BIPT, a software organization focused primarily on the development, deployment and support of policy and claims administration software for the P&C insurance industry.

As your cause partner, we strive to create tools that make it easier for social good organizations to engage communities, raise funds, rally supporters and make their voices heard.

Over the last decade plus, supporter engagement has changed dramatically. Donors and advocates became overloaded with information from everywhere. They were no longer responding to ‘one-size-fits-all’ outreach from nonprofits and instead came to expect personal, relevant interactions both online and offline.

Until recently, though, only larger organizations could afford such sophisticated, personalized communication tools. So, we set out to change the game for the 98% of nonprofits who desperately needed a modern, affordable solution to their engagement needs.

In 2015, Salsa merged with DonorPro, the premier donor management software company, forming one powerful constituent engagement and management platform.

Our integrated, cloud-based and mobile SaaS solution, provides businesses with a single login for anytime, anywhere access to all of their key data.

Having founded, led and successfully exited four technology companies over a twenty year period, our founder, Joseph Meyer, knows what it takes to run a business. However, with each successive venture, Joseph found that increasingly complex administrative functions were consuming more and more of his workday; a dilemma that did little to invigorate his entrepreneurial spirit. Further complicating the situation was the difficulty in getting the growing number of back office software and service solutions to “talk to each other.”

As a result of this ineffective and inefficient process, Joseph set out to help small businesses reduce their administrative burdens and eliminate the excess costs and inefficiencies associated with the traditional “duct taped” approach to managing back office functions; and so, CentralBOS was born.

Chris' focus on associations was born out of direct experience in local associations in Des Moines, Iowa and Lansing, Michigan. In order to make day-to-day administration of association websites easier, Chris created an event calendar that could be updated by an association's officers. Chris then added a Member Database that would automatically update an email list, allowing officers to easily send out broadcast emails. After that, features were continually added as people asked for more features.

It quickly became apparent that different organizations, large and small, could take advantage of the features of these systems. All of these were wrapped together under the title of Member Management System. It's now shared by a growing list of 100's of organizations who have access to it on a subscription basis.

11335,"","","","","","Before we started CauseVox, we found ourselves volunteering at nonprofits to scale their impact. We worked on everything from systems implementations to marketing projects for NGOs in South Africa, Uganda, and India.

One of the puzzling things that came up was why people, who were making such a profound change in communities, struggled with scaling their social impact. Why did they have to fight in order to make this world a better place for all of us to live?

Back in the States, we dug around for the answer. We talked to hundreds of people — people that volunteered, people that worked at nonprofits, and founders of nonprofits. We joined an incubator for social good and a community group for social entrepreneurs. We even moved from Washington DC to NYC to be closer to the nonprofits that we knew. We really wanted to figure out why there was a struggle.

The one thing we kept on hearing was that raising funds was always a challenge and using technology was always hard; these people were struggling for funding and wrangling with software every day. They always were trying to find new ways to find new donors. Major donors and grants were drying up because of the recession. Galas and events were too costly to organize.

That’s where CauseVox comes in to fix this broken system.

After testing the crowdfunding concept on our own volunteer projects — we built our own crowdfunding platform to raise funds for our volunteer projects — we launched CauseVox for all nonprofits and individuals to use.

We wanted to find a way for nonprofits and social good projects to raise funds online that is affordable, easy to use, yet powerful enough for professionals.

As a working-mom, Girl Scout leader, and active PTA member, Karen enjoyed contributing where she could, but the ‘little things’ that made volunteering a hassle and distracted her from the rest of life—clipboards, multiple websites, reply-all emails, late night reminder messages—seemed endless.

Karen recognized that for her efforts to make a meaningful difference, she needed to simplify how community activities were organized. In 2009, she founded VolunteerSpot, a solution for anyone and everyone who wanted to quickly mobilize and coordinate volunteers. VolunteerSpot's simple, intuitive signup software made it easy for people to join together and say YES to volunteering.

11403,"","","","","","Founded in 1983 as Professional Support Software, the company has grown and evolved from a local computer-consulting and custom-software firm into FundRaiser Software, ""home of the FundRaiser Family of donor management software for nonprofit organizations"", with clients and users around the world.

FundRaiser began as so many small businesses do: from sheer necessity and on a shoestring. My wife and I had moved from the eastern seaboard to a small town in south-central Missouri on the promise of a job, which came true, but then dissolved after a few months. A long job-hunt later, I decided to take matters into my own hands and find a niche which needed filling. Since personal computers were finally reaching even the middle of the country, and I had some experience in the field, that seemed to fit the bill.

The first two years were largely taken up with designing and writing one local client's custom software, and then I went on to other consulting and programming clients in an ever-widening geographical area. The program that eventually evolved into FundRaiser Professional was originally a custom program for a local politician's campaign fundraising efforts. In the first two decades after its birth, FundRaiser added two ""sibling"" programs, FundRaiser Select and the baby of the family, FundRaiser Basic. In its third decade now, the family continues to grow with FundRaiser Spark, which nicely fits between Basic and Select, and Online versions of all four. We also have a Donor and Volunteer Portal for website integration with FundRaiser.

As the FundRaiser programs have gained users and gained in sophistication, the consulting and custom-programming efforts of the original company dwindled until about 1993 when the entire focus of the company became the FundRaiser programs: improving them, marketing them, and supporting them.

In 2010, I began to want to take a less active role in running the company, and I gladly passed FundRaiser to the capable hands of Autumn and Joshua Shirley. They continue the work my wife and I began, taking it farther, yet retaining the supportive environment we created for both our staff and our customers. I am still active as part of the software development team, and on a consulting basis for Autumn and Joshua.

It has always been my belief that prompt, friendly, and expert technical support is vital to the users of any software. It was my intention from the beginning to supply just that to my clients. When I retired from the position of CEO, one of my main objectives in choosing new leadership was to make sure that this continued. According to FundRaiser users, we have been successful in that endeavor. Most new clients are simply amazed by the patience and friendliness of our support staff.

FundRaiser has been growing for over two decades now, and we have big plans for the future, helping nonprofits with affordable donor management software that they can grow into, accessible and friendly tech support, and a continually improving family of affordable products.

In 1997, Ed Schipul quit his fulltime job as a software consultant for a large petroleum corporation and started his own web marketing company. Armed with a Political Science degree from Texas A&M, a background in programming and a fascination with social trends, Ed started building web sites that helped people communicate. Years of custom requests from his nonprofit clients led to the initial construction of Tendenci, a platform of tools that most organizations need, or could use, to increase both their communciation and revenue streams.

In 2004, Tendenci received its official name and was sold by Schipul to clients around the world, filling a need for affordable membership management and association website marketing software. Other membership software applications were either too costly, too technical or not robust enough to manage the complex transactions for membership management, email marketing, event management, and donations management. Tendenci was developed to solve these problems and provide a simpler, better, and cheaper solution.

In 2012, Tendenci was released as an open source product to extend its reach even further, allowing developers around the world the ability to download and build on the Tendenci platform. In November 2013, Schipul officially changed its name to Tendenci to focus on the expansion of the software and the developer community.

Your supporters get email, search the internet, make purchases, and conduct their business on their smartphone, tablet, or computer. You must provide an easy way for them to participate in your events, campaigns, and donate, at the touch of button. Keeping up with an ever changing landscape, like software, can feel daunting. That's why, at bidcoz, we make it our job to do the heavy lifting, keeping up with the latest trends and changes in technology so you don't have to.

Renowned for its work in chart of accounts design, financial and enterprise reporting, and ERP implementations, GL Associates was unable to answer the call of controllers and sales executives who clamored for low-cost, simple, fast, value-added access to their very own enterprise data. As the finance function evolved from a transactional to decision support role, these companies were left with relatively static enterprise reporting.  The prevailing solutions seemed to universally rely upon costly, burdensome data warehouse back-ended business intelligence packages.

Fast-forward to 2002, when GL Associates launched Cetova to ease the reporting pains of the business community.  From Cito and Valeo, Latin for Speed and Strength, Cetova targeted end-users with a fast, robust alternative to traditional multidimensional analysis tools.  While most Corporate Performance Management solutions led organizations to spend sometimes millions of dollars on new IT departments, data warehouses, servers, consulting, and training, Cetova would introduce affordable business intelligence to its clients.  At Cetova, we believe that an accounting organization should be able to slice and dice its own numbers, with minimal hardware and software support, for little more than its petty cash budget.

Liz had identified a gap in the marketplace and together with Colm they created a solution for businesses to find highly targeted, pre qualified sales leads without having to trawl through the internet. In 2013 SalesOptimize was born, the idea being: ‘any business selling to online merchants would have easy access to their future customers’. The difficulty of B2B lead generation was now gone. This lead generation solution was quickly picked up by Wayra, a start-up accelerator programme.

WHIZTEC uses advanced service oriented architecture (SOA) and business process management technologies to provide richly configurable applications to companies with robust application and data integration capabilities, along with improved workflow. The major business driver is to help customers quickly transform their business structures and processes, and the way they do business. To achieve this, WHIZTEC uses web based tools and technologies to deliver its services to customers and its software development team uses agile software development methodology and extreme programming.

WHIZTEC delivers its products to its customers using Software as a Service (SaaS) business model. SaaS is a method of delivering software over the Internet whereby the software and customer data is hosted on the provider's servers enabling the customer anytime/anywhere access and alleviating the customer’s concerns about daily technical operations, software maintenance and upgrades.  WHIZTEC believes that the small and medium size business owners are ready to adopt the SaaS model in order to obtain more sophisticated (enterprise level) functionality in their business software without worrying about IT infrastructure.

WHIZTEC enterprise applications are designed for how business works today and is delivered and implemented as software-as-a-service unlike the transaction driven ERP products available in the market. WHIZTEC envisions that its web based products and services will optimize the supply chain, help the stakeholders to have a greater visibility that will in-turn reduce the bullwhip effect. The bullwhip effect has been perceived by the industry as an unavoidable ripple effect of supply-demand variation.

14602,11000 Regency Pkwy #110,"",Cary,"","","Dude Solutions was founded in 1999 with a singular vision firmly in mind: to improve the efficiency, safety and operations of the places we live, work and learn. We started this journey by creating SchoolDude – our flagship platform – aimed at helping educational institutions improve the way they manage, maintain and invest in their facilities. Over the years we have continually enhanced the platform and added critical functionality – such as IT asset management, energy management, inventory management and solutions that help communities better utilize school property for off-hours use. Today, thousands of institutions and over 1.5 million users interact with SchoolDude on a regular basis… but that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

Based on the success of the SchoolDude platform, Dude Solutions expanded operations in 2007 and created FacilityDude – a robust suite aimed at delivering the same efficiencies to local governments, clubs and associations, manufacturers, and other commercial businesses. In 2014, we added TheWorxHub to our portfolio and expanded our facility management expertise to organizations in the senior living, hospital and healthcare industries.

Taken together, Dude Solutions helps to maintain, improve and optimize the day-to-day operation of billions of square feet of facilities across North America. Leveraging a robust pool of data and one of the best support organizations in the business, we help our clients to gain valuable insight by establishing and reviewing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), comparing their performance with that of their peers and driving continuous improvement.","","",,false,"","","","",Unknown,"",Dude Solutions,https://d3uimxdj41cg3o.cloudfront.net/companies/2548e0a7d08ca169af9729e03206e6a1-1bb87d41d15fe27b500a4bfcde01bb0e/resources/logo_normal.png?1479173157,"","",Privately Owned,(866) 455-3833,,0,,dude-solutions,NC,,Full tax,"",Unknown,https://www.dudesolutions.com/,"",Unknown,,,27518
